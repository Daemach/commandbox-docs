# Run unit test suite from the command line

There is a `testbox run` command available that will run your unit or integration tests from the command line.  It assumes a couple things:

1. Your server is running (Doesn't have to be a CommandBox server)
2. You've configured a runner URL in your projects's `box.json`.
