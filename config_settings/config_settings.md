# CommandBox Config Settings

CommandBox has a global configuration file that stores user settings.  It is located in `~/.CommandBox/CommandBox.json` and can be used to customize core CommandBox behaviors as well as overriding module settings.  Config settings are managed by the `config set`, `config show`, and `config clear` commands, or you can directly edit the `CommandBox.json` file.
