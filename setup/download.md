# Download

If you already have a Java JRE installed level 1.7 or higher (and set in
your environment variables) you can [download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download) the non-JRE version for
your Operating System. 

>**Info** The non-JRE versions are all around 33MB in size, while the embedded JRE versions will go up to 80MB in size.

<br>

>**Hint** If you don't have a JRE installed or aren't sure, we would recommend you [download](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download) the version with a JRE included.
