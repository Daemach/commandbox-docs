# Installation

Regardless of where you place the **box** binary, the first time you execute
it, a `.CommandBox` folder will be created in your user's home
directory and CommandBox will be extracted into that location. If you
delete this directory, it will be replaced the next time the CommandBox
executable is run. 

You can specify a different install location by adding `-commandbox_home=E:\CommandBox` when you run the box binary.

To avoid specifying the commandbox_home variable every time you can create a file 
called `commandbox.properties` (case sensitive) in the same directory as 
the binary, and fill it with this line: 

```bash
commandbox_home=E:\\CommandBox 
```

## <i class="fa fa-windows"></i> Windows

Unzip the executable **box.exe** and just double click on it to open the
shell. When you are finished running commands, you can just close the
window, or type `exit`.

>**Hint** You can make the `box.exe` available in any Windows
terminal by adding its location to the `PATH` system environment
variable. See http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm
