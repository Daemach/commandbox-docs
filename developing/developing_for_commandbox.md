# Developing For CommandBox

 CommandBox is written in CFML, which puts any CFML developer in a position to easily build upon it for their own needs.  CommandBox is not only a CLI tool and collection of pre-built commands, but also an extensible framework for building your own CFML-based automations.  The core is modular such that anyone can extend it themselves or via the help of community modules hosted on ForgeBox, or any other installation endpoint.  
 
## Modularity

The unit of re-use in CommandBox is the module.  A module is nothing more than a folder containing some settings and code that follows a convention.  Modules mean that you can develop your own additions and customizations to the tool without needing to modify the core code.
