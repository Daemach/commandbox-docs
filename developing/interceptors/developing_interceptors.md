# Developing Interceptors

Interceptors are a powerful event-driven model inside CommandBox that allows you to listen to broadcasts from within the core code to respond to events and even influence execution.  Interceptors are packaged within CommandBox Modules and can be for your own use, just debugging, or to share with the world.
