# Developing Modules

The unit of re-use in CommandBox is the module.  A module is a folder containing some settings and code that follows a convention.  Modules allow you you to develop your own additions and customizations to the tool without needing to modify the core code.  If you have worked with the ColdBox MVC framework, CommandBox modules are very similar to ColdBox modules.  If not, don't worry, they're very simple to learn.
