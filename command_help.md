# Command Help

Help is integrated at every level in CommandBox.  You can help global help, namespace help, or command help at any time.  

## Global Help

To get an overall list of all the commands you have available to run, simply type `help` at the shell.

To get further help on any of the items above, type "help command name".
```
## Namespace Help
Next, drill down and get help on a specific namespace like `server`.

## Command Help
And finally, and get help on a single command such as `server stop`.  We can see the command is also aliased as just `stop` as well as all the possible parameters and their types along with a few sample ways to call the command.
