# Parameters

Many commands accept parameters to control how they function. Parameters are entered on the same line as the command and separated by a space and can be provided as named OR positional, similar to how CFML functions can be called. You cannot mix named and positional parameters in the same command or an error will be thrown. There is also a concept of "flag" for boolean parameters that can be combined with named or positional parameters for brevity and readability.
