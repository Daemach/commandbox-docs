If you don't already have CommandBox in hand, download it from the product page on the Ortus Solutions site:
* [http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox#download)
 
If you already have Java 1.6 or higher installed on your PC, choose the **No JRE Included** download for your operating system.  Otherwise, you can grab the **With JRE Included** for a single-download solution.

You're well on your way now.   While you wait for arrival you might want to secure any loose hair or shirt sleeves and clear a clean space to work on your desktop.  Safety first!


## 2. Unzip and First Run

Your CommandBox is sent to you via a zip archive.  Decompress the archive to a location of your choice.  The **No JRE Included** download will only have one file in  it.  For Windows users, this will be an exe file.  For unix-based users, it will be an executable binary.The **With JRE Included** version will have a jre folder.  Keep that folder in the same location as the executable so it can be found.
