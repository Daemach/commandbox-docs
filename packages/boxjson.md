# Box.json

The `box.json` file must be in your root of your project and it is a JSON file that describes your project, dependencies, development dependencies, installation data, and CommandBox command data. Below you will see all the possible options that we currently support in CommandBox. If you have suggestions or updates to our pacakage descriptor, please do not hesitate to [Contact Us](https://groups.google.com/a/ortussolutions.com/forum/#!forum/commandbox)!

>**Note** : Please note that you can add as many settings or alter the `box.json` structure to meet your needs when developing commands. This makes our descriptor incredibly flexible.
