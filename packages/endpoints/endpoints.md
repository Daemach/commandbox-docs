# Code Endpoints

For CommandBox to be able to install packages for you it needs to connect to code repository where packages are stored so it can download them for installation. CommandBox integrates seamlessly with ForgeBox, our community of ColdFusion (CFML) projects. CommandBox also integrates with HTTP(S), local file/folder, and Git endpoints.
