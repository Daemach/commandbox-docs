# Code Endpoints

For CommandBox to be able to install packages for you it needs to connect to code repository where packages are stored so it can download them for installation. CommandBox integrates seamlessly with ForgeBox, our community of ColdFusion (CFML) projects. CommandBox will soon be able to integrate with git, svn, http, ftp and custom code endpoints.
